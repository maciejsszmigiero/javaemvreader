# javaemvreader

A Java library and application for reading and interacting with EMV payment cards.

## A note from Maciej S. Szmigiero
This project's previous home was [sasc999's GitHub repository](https://github.com/sasc999/javaemvreader),
but it looks like it was abandoned somewhere near the end of 2014, with later pull requests and
issues remaining unactioned.

I have decided to fork it in order to merge some of these pull requests and also add few improvements on my own.

The project is provided "as-is", the codebase that was forked has not been audited by me (or, as far as I know, by anybody else),
so *caveat emptor*, especially due to nature of data that this software processes.
